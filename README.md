A little app, a soup√ßon mayhaps, that let's me search Spotify by artist, see some info, and play a few tracks.

## Issues

Spotify's API used to be free, but now even getting public info requires authentication. Why do I care? Because my access and refresh tokens expire too quickly. I'm working on it, but while I have to get new ones, I am just working on the functionality and will save styling for later since that is something I can do at a dodgy bar surrounded by ne'er-do-wells.

Toolbox:

- ReactJS
- Ant Design
- Spotify's API
